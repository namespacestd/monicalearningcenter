        <h1>Our Program</h1>
        <p>In addition to teaching content review, Monica Learning Center tutors teach time management skills and test--taking tips and strategies. MLC routinely provides practice testing to help diagnose and focus on areas of strength and weakness, and furnish reasons for incorrect responses. Students learn invaluable methods to overcome test-taking anxiety and "freezing" on tests.
        <p>Monica Learning Center achieves its success by emphasizing individual attention and specialized focus on each studentÅfs needs. In order to best serve each student, we offer a variety of options for tutoring: classes with a low student-teacher ratio, small group tutoring, or private one-on-one tutoring. Please contact us to discuss the availability of classes and tutoring for any given subject, including standardized tests.
        <h2>Weekend Program</h2>
        <p>Our weekend courses provide your student with individualized attention to address specific academic needs. Lessons focused on the requirements of your student will allow him or her to experience greater success at school. We offer classes in mathematics, science, English, and test preparation.
        <h2>Afterschool Tutoring</h2>
        <p>Our afterschool tutoring program offers homework help, small-group tutoring, and enrichment programs for K-12 students. Through this program, students will acquire improved academic habits, accurately completed homework, greater conceptual understanding of subject material, more confidence and motivation, and individualized feedback. For each program, students may choose to enroll from 1 to 5 days per week.
        <h2>Summer Program</h2>
        <p>In the MLC Summer Camp Program, youth of all ages are able to explore the worlds of science, technology, sports, art, and academia through hands-on learning. We offer half-day, extended-day, and full-day options. Our program is a great way for students to stay academically engaged over the summer months and to prepare them for the upcoming school year in a fun and entertaining environment. Includes local field trips</p>
